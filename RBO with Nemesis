Reverse Boss Order Route, CS3D

sections organized by my speedrun splits
*#* or *TA denotes reloading the game and loading the respective file
if an object is just stated, it generally means to interact with that object by pressing Down. Stuff that's done as the glitchless or regular progression will generally be omitted - please practice the route first.

Area names inside asterisks are a helper to keep track of where you should end up
