Bosses must be killed "as intended" through damage - simply flagging them defeated is not enough - in the opposite order of their intended order, with the exception of Ballos - as the game ends after his defeat - and Heavy Press - who it is impossible to save after defeating as of this moment.
 
It is allowed to trigger the death of bosses so long as that boss can still be defeated in the sequence required.
 
This route is not optimized and missing some things i right now just know how to do, after CSM submissions (TODAY) i'm going to clean it up and do some optimizing.
 
You can grind health a bit for safety at Labyrinth I, by item quitting in Labyrinth H and overflowing off of anything in the room.
 
There are detailed info on Item Quit and other things somewhere in the depths of this pastebin, and i'll have a writeup on why things are in this route eventually.
 
Massive thanks to periwinkle, ikuyo, and the rest of the CS+ community for all their contributions that made me break this game in the first place in the ways i did.
